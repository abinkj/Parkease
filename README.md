# ParkEase: Smart Parking Management System 


## Getting Started
ParkEase is an innovative solution designed to tackle the challenges of increasing urbanization and the growing number of vehicles on the road. It addresses the strain on existing parking infrastructure while improving traffic management and reducing congestion.

This Flutter App delivers a seamless user interface, while the backend is powered by OpenCV in Python and Firebase, combining advanced image processing with reliable cloud-based database management.

##How It Works
ParkEase uses an OpenCV-based image detection program to identify free parking spots. The system calculates noise differences in designated parking areas to detect the presence or absence of vehicles. By analyzing these differences, the system determines the number of available parking spots in real time for each parking location. This information is stored and updated in a Firebase database, ensuring accuracy and availability for users.

With ParkEase, users no longer need to physically visit a parking location to check availability. Instead, they can view real-time updates on free parking spots directly through the app. Additionally, the Google Maps API integration enhances convenience by showing users the nearest available parking locations based on their current location and providing step-by-step navigation to the selected spot.

##Key Features:
Real-Time Free Spot Detection: Utilizes OpenCV image processing to calculate noise differences and identify free parking spots.
Firebase Integration: Ensures seamless real-time data updates for accurate parking availability.
Google Maps API Integration: Provides navigation to the nearest available parking spot based on the user's current location.
Data Insights: Tracks parking usage patterns to inform future planning and development.
User-Friendly Flutter Interface: A modern, intuitive app design for effortless interaction.
Traffic Congestion Reduction: Reduces traffic by guiding users directly to available parking spots.
ParkEase eliminates the hassle of searching for parking, making it easier for users to locate free spots while contributing to better traffic management. Itâ€™s a transformative solution for urban transportation, combining real-time detection, cloud-based data handling, and seamless navigation for a smarter parking experience.
